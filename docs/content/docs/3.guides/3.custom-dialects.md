title: Database Dialects
description: How dialect selection affects schema generation.
---

Schema generation supports:

- `sqlite`
- `postgresql`
- `mysql`

Set the dialect via NuxtHub config:

```ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  hub: {
    db: { dialect: 'postgresql' },
  },
})
```

The generated schema is written to `.nuxt/better-auth/schema.<dialect>.ts` and merged into NuxtHub.

If you use non‑sqlite dialects, verify your Better Auth adapter configuration in your app, as only sqlite is currently tested by default.
