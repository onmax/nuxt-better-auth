## Why Nuxt Better Auth?

Building authentication from scratch is hard. Wiring up Better Auth with Nuxt manually involves:
- Setting up API handlers
- Managing database connections
- Syncing client/server state
- Handling redirects

This module does all of that for you. It's designed to be **drop-in** and **zero-config** where possible.
