title: Schema Generation
description: Auto-generate Drizzle tables from Better Auth plugins.
---

When Nuxt starts, the module:

1. Loads your `server/auth.config.ts` to read `plugins`.
2. Calls Better Auth’s `getAuthTables({ plugins })`.
3. Generates a Drizzle schema file into `.nuxt/better-auth/schema.<dialect>.ts`.
4. Extends the NuxtHub database schema with those tables.

Supported dialects are `sqlite`, `postgresql`, and `mysql`. The dialect is read from `hub.db`.

## Notes

- Regeneration happens on server start. Restart dev server after changing plugins.
- If `hub.db` is not configured, schema generation is skipped (you’ll see a warning).
