## Debugging

Enable verbose logging:

```ini [.env]
DEBUG=better-auth*
```

Check browser DevTools Network tab for `/api/auth/*` requests.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I use this without a database?

Yes, using [database-less mode](/guides/database-less-mode). Sessions are stored in encrypted cookies. This mode limits some features like session revocation.

### Does this work with Nuxt 2?

No. This module requires Nuxt 3.10 or later.

### What's the difference from nuxt-auth-utils?

Nuxt Better Auth uses the Better Auth library, which provides:
- More authentication methods (OAuth, magic links, passkeys)
- Plugin ecosystem for features like 2FA, organizations
- TypeScript-first design with full type inference

See the [migration guide](/guides/migrate-from-nuxt-auth-utils) for detailed comparison.

### Can I use a different database?

Yes. Better Auth supports any database with a Drizzle, Prisma, or Kysely adapter. See [Better Auth database documentation](https://www.better-auth.com/docs/database).

### How do I add custom fields to the user?

Configure in Better Auth, then augment types:

```ts [server/auth.config.ts]
import { defineServerAuth } from '@onmax/nuxt-better-auth/config'

export default defineServerAuth({
  user: {
    additionalFields: {
      role: { type: 'string', defaultValue: 'user' }
    }
  }
})
```

## Common Errors

## NuxtHub version requirement

If using NuxtHub for database features, you need `@nuxthub/core` version **0.10.0** or higher. NuxtHub is optional - see [NuxtHub Integration](/integrations/nuxthub) for details.

```bash
pnpm add @nuxthub/core@latest
```

## "Missing server/auth.config.ts"

The module validates config files at build time.
Create `server/auth.config.ts` exporting `defineServerAuth(...)`.

## "Missing app/auth.config.ts"

The module expects a client config file at `app/auth.config.ts` exporting `createAppAuthClient` via `defineClientAuth()`.

## "auth.config.ts validation failed"

- Ensure the file exports `createServerAuth` via `defineServerAuth()`.
- Do not set `secret`/`baseURL` manually (the module injects these).
- Confirm the file is at the expected path (default: `server/auth.config.ts`).

## No schema file is generated

Schema generation requires NuxtHub. Ensure NuxtHub is installed and DB is configured:

```ts
hub: { db: { dialect: 'sqlite' } }
```

Restart dev server after changing Better Auth plugins.

## `routeRules` changes don't apply

`routeRules` are synced to page meta during `pages:extend`.
Restart dev server after updating route rules.

## API routes aren't protected

Only `routeRules.auth` is enforced for `/api/**`.
Use `routeRules.auth` (or call `requireUserSession(event)` inside handlers) to enforce access.
