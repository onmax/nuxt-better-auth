description: What is enforced where, and what you should not assume.

## Client redirects are not security

Route middleware redirects are for UX, not security. Always enforce access on the server.

## API enforcement behavior

The built-in Nitro middleware only checks `routeRules.role` for `/api/**`.

If you want different behavior (e.g. enforce `auth: 'user'` for APIs), add your own Nitro middleware and/or call `requireUserSession(event)` directly inside handlers.

## Default login route

Unauthenticated users are redirected to `/login` when a page requires auth. If your app uses a different login path, create a `/login` route or implement your own route middleware.
