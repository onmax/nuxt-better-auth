description: When to reach for the full Better Auth server instance.
---

`serverAuth(event)` returns the memoized Better Auth instance for the current request. Prefer the helper utilities for common checks, and reach for `serverAuth(event)` when you need the full Better Auth API or plugin-specific endpoints.

## When to Use What

| Task | Use | Example |
|------|-----|---------|
| Get current session | `getUserSession(event)` | Check if user is logged in |
| Require authentication | `requireUserSession(event)` | Protect an API route |
| Access Better Auth API | `serverAuth(event)` | Call `auth.api.listSessions()` |
| Get session with options | `requireUserSession(event, { role: 'admin' })` | Role-based protection |
