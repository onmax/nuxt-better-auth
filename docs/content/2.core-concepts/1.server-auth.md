title: `serverAuth()`
description: How the server Better Auth instance is created.
---

`serverAuth()` is auto‑imported on the server. It:

- Calls your `defineServerAuth` function from `server/auth.config.ts`.
- Injects the Drizzle adapter, secret, and baseURL.
- Caches the instance for the lifetime of the server.

```ts
const auth = serverAuth()
const session = await auth.api.getSession({ headers: event.headers })
```

You rarely need to call it directly unless you’re building custom server logic.
