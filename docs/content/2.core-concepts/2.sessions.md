title: Sessions
description: SSR‑safe session state via `useUserSession()`.
---

`useUserSession()` is auto‑imported on the client and server.

```ts
const {
  user,
  session,
  loggedIn,
  ready,
  signIn,
  signUp,
  signOut,
  fetchSession,
} = useUserSession()
```

## SSR behavior

- On the server, the module initializes state but does not fetch a session.
- On the client, a plugin calls `fetchSession()` on first load.
- `ready` flips to `true` after the first fetch attempt.

Use `ready` or `<BetterAuthState>` when you need to wait for hydration.
