## Unreleased

### Breaking Changes

- **NuxtHub 0.10.5+ required**: The module now imports from `@nuxthub/db` and `@nuxthub/kv` instead of virtual `hub:db` modules. This fixes runtime errors in development mode where Node.js could not resolve the `hub:` protocol. Users must upgrade to `@nuxthub/core@0.10.5` or later.

## 0.1.0

Initial release of Nuxt Better Auth.

**Features:**
- Automatic route protection via `routeRules` and `definePageMeta`
- Reactive session management with `useUserSession()`
- NuxtHub integration with schema generation
- DevTools panel for development
- Full TypeScript inference from Better Auth plugins
